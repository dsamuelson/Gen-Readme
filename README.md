## Description

This really simple readme generator uses inquirer to prompt you for answers to any needed sections for a quality readme

![Questions example in terminal](/images/questions-screen.png)

Once the questions have completed you'll either get a confirmation that the README.md has been generated

![confirmation output](/images/confirmation-cli.png)

or you'll get an error

After that you can check the README.md file in the /dist folder which should show you everything properly formatted in the markdown viewer
